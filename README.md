# Auto Cryptanalysis
This project implements python module for automatic cryptanalysis of Substitution Permutation Network
ciphers by performing extensive linear and differential characteristic search and finding keybits

## Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- The `cryptanalysis` directory contains the main Python module for cryptanalysis.
- The `tests` directory contains unit tests for the module
- The `examples` directory contains examples for using the module
- The `docs` directory contains html documentation autogenerated from code doc-strings

## Installation

### Pip
The project can be installed directly from pip
```bash
pip install cryptanalysis
```

Otherwise clone and install is also viable

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deut-erium/auto-cryptanalysis.git
cd auto-cryptanalysis.git
pip install .
```

### Requirements
This project requires Python3.6+ and the following Python packages:
- z3-solver
- tqdm

Requirements are auto installed as a part of the installation process but

You can also install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

## Tests
You can run the tests using the following command:
